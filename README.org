* flymake-transient-keys

Flymake backend to check duplicated keys in =define-transient-prefix= forms.

** Requirements
+ Emacs >= 26.1
+ flymake

** Installation

*** Manual

Download the source code and put it wherever you like, and add the directory to the load path:

#+begin_src elisp :eval no
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/flymake-transient-keys")
(require 'flymake-transient-keys)
#+end_src

*** With use-package and straight

#+begin_src elisp :eval no
(use-package flymake-transient-keys
  :straight (flymake-transient-keys
             :repo "KarimAziev/flymake-transient-keys"
             :type git
             :host github))
#+end_src
** Usage

*** M-x flymake-transient-keys RET

To check all transient prefixes in the buffer.

Instead of a command, you can also use a hook:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'flymake-transient-keys)
#+end_src

*** M-x flymake-transient-keys-current RET

Limit checks to transient at the point.

Instead of a command, you can also use a hook:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'flymake-transient-keys-current)
#+end_src
